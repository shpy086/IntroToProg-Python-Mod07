# Pickling and Stuctured Error Handling
## Introduction
In this assignment, we are asked to create a script that demonstrates how pickling and structured error handling are implemented in Python. In the first part of the script, I will explain how pickling can be used to store data on a .dat file in binary format and then loaded from a .dat file and converted into its original readable format. In the second part of the script, I will explain how structured error handling can be used to trap errors in the program and relay them back to the user. 
## Pickling
Pickling is a technique that allows us to preserve data in binary format as opposed to storing it as “plain text”. Python.org defines pickling as “implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.” The main benefits of pickling are the ability to store more complex data (relative to text files) with a single line of code and reducing its storage size. Figure 1 below shows the code in the data and processing layers of the script:
